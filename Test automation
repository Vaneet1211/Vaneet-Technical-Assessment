To automate the HRS booking portal for the specified user flow, we need to cover critical scenarios to ensure a seamless booking experience. Here's a breakdown of the automation tasks:

1. User Authentication:
   Automate the process of user authentication by entering valid login credentials (username and password) into the system.

2. Hotel Search:
   - Implement automation to search for hotels in Barcelona for the specified date range (21.06.2024 to 28.06.2024).
   - Filter out hotels based on availability to exclude those with low availability using the new feature in the Booking API.

3. View Hotel Details:
   - Automate the process of selecting a specific hotel from the search results.
   - Verify that the hotel details page displays essential information such as location, amenities, room types, and pricing.

4. Room Selection:
   - Automate the selection of a room type based on user preferences (e.g., single room, double room, suite).
   - Ensure that the chosen room is available for the specified date range.

5. Booking Process:
   - Automate the booking process by entering the necessary guest details (e.g., name, contact information).
   - Verify that the booking summary is displayed accurately, including the total cost and any applicable taxes or fees.

6. Payment Processing:
   - Automate the payment process by entering valid payment information (e.g., credit card details).
   - Verify that the payment is processed successfully and a confirmation message is displayed.

7. Confirmation Email:
   - Automate the verification of the confirmation email sent to the user's registered email address.
   - Ensure that the email contains relevant booking details and instructions for managing the booking if needed.

8. Error Handling:
   - Implement automation to handle potential errors during the booking process, such as network issues, server errors, or invalid input.
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user and the system gracefully handles the errors without crashing.

9. User Feedback:
   - Automate the process of collecting user feedback after the booking is completed.
   - Prompt the user to rate their booking experience and provide any comments or suggestions for improvement.

10. Integration Testing:
    - Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless communication between the HRS booking portal and the Booking API's new feature for filtering out hotels with low availability.
    - Verify that the filtered search results align with the specified criteria and accurately reflect the available hotel options.

By automating these critical scenarios, we can ensure that the HRS booking portal provides users with a smooth and efficient experience for booking hotels in Barcelona for their specified travel dates.
